# MCJESP
Monte-Carlo Joint Equilibrium Search for a Policy in Dec-POMDPs

This is a C++ implementation of the MCJESP algorithm [1]. It aims to solve Dec-POMDP infinite-horizon problems by finding Nash-equilibrium solutions, only requiring black-box Dec-POMDP simulators.

## Installation

Tested systems:

* Linux
* Mac OS X

Dependencies:

* cmake >= 2.8
* C++ 11 is required

Once you have all required dependencies, you can simply execute the following commands from the project's main folder:

```
cmake ./
make
```

## Quick Start

The generated executable file is called "RunExperiments".  To run the program with Dec-POMDP benchmarks, just type:

```
./RunExperiments
```

Help Manual is also provided by typing:
```
./RunExperiments -h
```
or

```
./RunExperiments --help
```
A cleaning shell script is written for cleaning the files generated by CMake. To execute it, just runï¼š

```
sh cleanCMAKE.sh
```


The result policy files are located in the "./TempFiles" folder which contains all the final policies at each restart.

## Model and solve a custom Dec-POMDP problem

To model and solve a custom Dec-POMDP problem, please apply the following two steps:

1. Model your custom Dec-POMDP problem by inheriting the *SimInterface* class 
    * This file is located at "./Include/SimInterface.h".
    * If there is an explicit Dec-POMDP file, you can also use *SimModel* (".Include/SimModel.h") to load it, it will be then read as a *SimInterface* object.

2. Load your custom Dec-POMDP and call MCJESP to solve it
    * A demo main file is provided at "./demo_main.cpp".
